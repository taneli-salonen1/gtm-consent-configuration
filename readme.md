# GTM Consent Configuration

This tag template is used to set and update the consent types in GTM. Once set, the consent settings can be used in GTM to allow/block tags from executing.

The tag can also add a consent granted listener. Once consent is updated and new consent types are granted, the tag will push events to the dataLayer listing all the newly granted consent types.
